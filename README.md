# MIKTI TEAM CHALLENGE

This project is developed as part of the MIKTI Studi Independen Team Challenge. The goal of the challenge is to create a REST API using Go and GORM as the ORM. The API is designed to support a small e-commerce platform where users can act as both sellers and buyers.

## Features

- User Management: Allows users to register and manage their profiles.
- Product Management: Enables users to add, update, and delete products.
- Transaction Management: Facilitates the process of creating and managing transactions between sellers and buyers.
- CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all entities.


## Tech Stack

- [Go](https://go.dev/): The programming language used to develop the API.
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/): The ORM library used for database operations.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): The database used to store the application data (choose one based on your setup).
- [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/): The web framework used to handle HTTP requests and routing.
